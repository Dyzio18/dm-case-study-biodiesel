Description: Experimental Results involving transesterification of rapeseed
oil in 3 alcohols (methanol, ethanol, and 1-propanol). Three factors were
varied: temperature (250, 300, 350C), pressure (8, 10, 12 MPa),
and time (7,15,20,...,60,65 min). Yields of each alcohol type (%)
and Energy consumption of each alcohol type (kW h/kg) were reported.
